### Make a **Postman** pull request

> Make your pull requests for contributions to the collection **in the Postman environment**, not in this repo!

The steps are very similar to making a pull request in Git:

1. [Create a fork of the collection](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/collection/12721794-7d783742-165f-4d10-8c4c-5719fb60fba2/fork?origin=sidebar) in Postman.

2. Make additions or other changes.

3. Choose **Create a pull request** using the three dots to the right of the collection name.

4. It is a good idea to pair a pull request with an issue describing the enhancement your work aims to address.

For details, see [creating a Postman pull request for a fork](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/version-control-overview/).
